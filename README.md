## About Misty's Print
Misty’s Prints is a PC story-driven, puzzle-based RPG where the user plays as a girl named Aribel as she follows Misty, her cat, into a seemingly abandoned library. The uniqueness of this game lies in the multiple small yet distinct stories she finds herself in as she searches for her cat, allowing the player to experience multiple genres (mystery, adventure, etc.) all within one cohesive experience.

## Game Structure
- **Prologue:** Story introduction, explore the library, and follow visuals to the first book
- **Book 1:** Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
- **Book 2:** The Call of Cthulhu
- **Book 3:** The Phantom of the Opera
- **Conclusion:** Unlock the library study where Misty is found sleeping, gets found by the bookkeeper, and final cutscene

## Game Engine
GameMaker Studio 2 will be utilized to streamline development and avoid unnecessary clutter that would come with using an engine non-specific to 2D development.
